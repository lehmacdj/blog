# Blog!
This is my first blog post! I've been wanting to start a programming blog for a while and finally got around to doing it.

# Who am I?
I am a rising sophomore attending Cornell University studying Computer Science and Biology. As far as programming goes I like and use:

+ vim, nvim, ex, ed
+ java, ocaml, perl, shell scripts
+ super smash bros. melee, dominion, hearthstone, minecraft
+ tmux, zsh, iTerm2
+ macOS, ubuntu, gnu/hurd
