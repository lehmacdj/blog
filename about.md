title: Who am I?
permalink: /about/

I am a rising sophomore attending Cornell University studying Computer Science
and Biology. I love the shell scripting, functional programming, math, (neo)vim,
and PL Theory as far as programming goes.

Sometimes I may post about topics that I am not an expert in. When I do so this
I am mostly trying to learn more about it or simply put my ideas into the world.
I am not trying to convey that I am an expert at that subject.
