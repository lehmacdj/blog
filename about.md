The UnformedDelta is the place where my thoughts and learnings collect like sand and soil at a river delta. Mostly the distillation of things I've learned or figured out.

This site is currently under construction. Stay tuned for more soon™️. In the short term, my main goal is to publish more often. In the longer term, I want to turn this into a web version of my personal Zettelkasten.
